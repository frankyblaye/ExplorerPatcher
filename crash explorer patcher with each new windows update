Hi,
Preview of Cumulative Update for Windows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems (KB5026446) and Updates for Windows (KB2693643)(KB5026446) and earlier, each time after installing these updates, at the time opening the windows desktop there is a total blockage and a black or white screen, including in safe mode.
It is therefore necessary, each time, to uninstall the update then to uninstall explorer patcher to finally reinstall the update.
Finally as soon as there is a new version of explorer patcher, it is installed and windows works perfectly.
Seems like every windows update blocks explorer patcher.
